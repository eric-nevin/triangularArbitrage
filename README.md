# triangularArbitrage
# This program takes foreign exchange market data (currency exchange rates) from the fixer.io API and looks for possibile arbitrage opportunites
# Example: Exchange rate 1 USD = 2 EUR, 2 EUR = 2 GBP, 2 GBP = 2 USD. This type of risk-free profit is rare and of a much smaller magnitude when it does occur.
